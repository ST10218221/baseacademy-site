# Goal
Create a complete, production-ready static website for Baseline Academy (a bass guitar teaching service) that can be hosted on GitHub Pages, with clean black and grey styling, intuitive navigation, and a prominent "Book Now" call-to-action. The website should be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where necessary, suitable for live coding in Replit. All content and documentation should use British English spelling and terminology.

# Return format
Deliver the following as a complete, functional codebase ready to use in Replit:
- Full HTML structure for all pages (Home, About, Services, Lessons, Contact, FAQ)
- Single consolidated CSS file with black and grey colour scheme
- JavaScript file for interactive elements (navigation, form handling, smooth scrolling)
- Complete documentation file with step-by-step instructions for:
  - Testing locally in Replit
  - Deploying to GitHub Pages without a custom domain
  - Deploying to GitHub Pages with a custom domain
- Placeholder image references with guidance on where to add actual images
- All files organised in the correct directory structure for GitHub Pages deployment

# Warnings
- Ensure all file paths use relative URLs (e.g., `./css/style.css`) to work correctly on GitHub Pages subdomains
- The "Book Now" CTA should appear consistently across multiple pages (header, hero section, services) to maximise conversions
- GitHub Pages requires the repository to be public; document this requirement clearly
- When deploying with a custom domain, DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours; include this caveat in documentation
- Placeholder images must be clearly marked so the user knows exactly where to replace them with actual content
- Ensure the navigation menu is responsive and functional on mobile devices
- Test all internal links before final deployment to avoid broken navigation
- Use British English spelling throughout all code comments, documentation, and user-facing content (e.g., "colour" not "color", "organise" not "organize", "maximise" not "maximize")

# Context

- Colour scheme: black and grey only (no other colours)
- Hosting platform: GitHub Pages (free static hosting)
- Development environment: Replit (browser-based IDE)
- Target audience: prospective bass guitar students
- The site should include suggested menu pages: Home, About, Services, Lessons, Contact, FAQ
- User wants images integrated during the coding process with placeholder guidance
- Documentation must cover both custom domain and non-custom domain GitHub Pages deployment scenarios
- All content, including code comments, variable names in user-facing elements, and documentation, should use British English conventions
